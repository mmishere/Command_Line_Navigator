A CLI navigator. Essentially, it allows you to `cd` between directories in a nicer way than the command line typically offers.

## How to use it
Launch the program with `python3 navigator.py`, select the option you want with the listed keys (options are listed as 1), 2), 3), etc.), and hit enter.

It lists the files in the current directory above the folders. You can only navigate to folders.

You can also use it to create and name new files and folders.
